# INSANE LIVESTOCK

insane livestock 3d on stream yay

BIG TODO:
- improve physics
    - make them not get stuck when attacking each other
    - make them not both die when attacking each other
    - maybe try making them more like a two wheeled bike instead of a car so theyre like balancing and its easy to kill one by hitting it in the side but not in the front

medium Todo:
- make the camera move when in main menu
- add join and death texts

small todo:
- colored names & stuf for like subs and vips
- customizable gamefield size
- restart the game
- explosion gif instead of the square
- skins with like !play 2 for example
- !baah and !explode
- streamer as player ?
